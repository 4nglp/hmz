        We're stealing your data. ALL of it.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Your name? Got it. Your location? Oh, we already sent that to everyone
        in our group chat. Your browser history? BroüíÄ... You should clear that
        sometime.
      </p>

        What We Do With Your Data
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We're using it to do really important things, like:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <li>Figuring out what you had for breakfast.</li>
        <li>
          Debating whether your fashion sense is worse than your taste in memes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using your data to calculate the exact moment you'll regret visiting
          this site.

        Why You Should Be Concerned
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We already know where you live, and we're thinking about putting it on a
        billboard downtown.
        <br />
        Keep an eye on the mail‚Äîyou might get a postcard with your Wi-Fi
        password on it.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-pink-300">
        Your Rights
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        You have the right to remain silent, but it won't matter because we can
        hear you through your webcam anyway.
        <br />
        Feel free to complain, but our customer service department is just a
        potato with a sticky note on it. ü•î
